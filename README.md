# Deklaracja IP

The "Declaracja IP" is a commercial project created for the Workers' Union's use. Thanks to the application, employees can join the trade union. 

The application consists of four steps: <br/> 1 A form that collects basic information about employees. <br/> 2 A clause regarding the use of personal data.<br/> 3 A summary of the data provided in the form. <br/> 4 A confirmation message indicating that the data has been sent to the union office.

The form data is transmitted via a backend application to the union office's email inbox.

The application's styles are designed based on the UI graphic design created in Figma.
